# Introduction

**libMMU** is a Rust crate that aims to simplify the process of rebuilding virtual address spaces from a memory dump in an OS-agnostic way. It is heavily based on the thesis [In the Land of MMUs: Multiarchitecture OS-Agnostic Virtual Memory Forensics](https://www.s3.eurecom.fr/docs/tops22_oliveri.pdf) by Andrea Oliveri and Davide Balzarotti and their POC [mmushell](https://github.com/eurecom-s3/mmushell).
